# AHB to APB Bridge




## About the AMBA Buses

The Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) specification defines an
on-chip communications standard for designing high-performance embedded
microcontrollers.
Three distinct buses are defined within the AMBA specification:
- Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)
- Advanced System Bus (ASB)
- Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB).

### Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB)
The AMBA AHB is for high-performance, high clock frequency system modules.
The AHB acts as the high-performance system backbone bus. AHB supports the
efficient connection of processors, on-chip memories and off-chip external memory
interfaces with low-power peripheral macrocell functions. AHB is also specified to
ensure ease of use in an efficient design flow using synthesis and automated test
techniques.
### Advanced System Bus (ASB)
The AMBA ASB is for high-performance system modules.
AMBA ASB is an alternative system bus suitable for use where the high-performance
features of AHB are not required. ASB also supports the efficient connection of
processors, on-chip memories and off-chip external memory interfaces with low-power
peripheral macrocell functions.
### Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB)
The AMBA APB is for low-power peripherals.
AMBA APB is optimized for minimal power consumption and reduced interface
complexity to support peripheral functions. APB can be used in conjunction with either
version of the system bus.
